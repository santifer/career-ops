/**
 * linkedin-apply.mjs - resolve a LinkedIn posting to the employer's real ATS application URL.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * A LinkedIn posting URL is not applyable. `openSession()` in the web app opens a
 * fresh, cookie-less browser context, so linkedin.com/jobs/view/<id> serves the
 * authwall and the apply flow dead-ends (issue #7).
 *
 * The obvious fix does not work. LinkedIn's public guest endpoint returns the full
 * posting with no auth, and it does say WHETHER a job applies offsite, but it does
 * not expose WHERE: the destination sits behind the contextual sign-in modal, and
 * the page carries no JSON-LD. So the apply URL has to be reconstructed, not read.
 *
 * This module reconstructs it from the two things the guest page does give us, the
 * employer and the job title, by reusing machinery career-ops already ships:
 *   1. guest endpoint            -> company, title, location, offsite-apply flag
 *   2. discover-ats resolveCompany -> the employer's live Greenhouse/Ashby/Lever board
 *   3. that board's provider       -> its current job list
 *   4. title matching here         -> the one posting that corresponds
 * Zero LLM tokens, zero auth, no browser.
 *
 * MATCHING IS DELIBERATELY CONSERVATIVE. A false match sends a real application to
 * the wrong role, which is worse than not resolving at all. This never auto-picks a
 * merely-plausible candidate: it returns `ambiguous` with a ranked list and lets a
 * human choose. See pickMatch() for the exact policy.
 *
 * Run: node linkedin-apply.mjs <linkedin-job-url> [--json|--summary]
 *      node linkedin-apply.mjs --self-test

linkedin-apply.mjs - resolve a LinkedIn posting to the employer's real application URL

Usage:
  node linkedin-apply.mjs <linkedin-job-url>            JSON (default)
  node linkedin-apply.mjs <linkedin-job-url> --summary  human-readable
  node linkedin-apply.mjs <url> --report <report.md>    resolve, then record **Apply URL:**
  node linkedin-apply.mjs --report <report.md> --set <url>   record a URL you chose
  node linkedin-apply.mjs --self-test                   inline test suite
  node linkedin-apply.mjs --help

--report writes only on a confident resolve; an ambiguous run records nothing, so
a guess never lands in the report where it would be acted on later.

LinkedIn's guest endpoint says whether a posting applies offsite but not where.
This reconstructs the destination from the employer plus the job title, using the
same ATS providers scan.mjs reads, so the result is a URL the apply flow can fill.

Matching refuses rather than guesses: a posting only resolves on a unique
high-confidence title match, and a seniority difference disqualifies outright.
Anything less comes back as ranked candidates for you to choose from.
