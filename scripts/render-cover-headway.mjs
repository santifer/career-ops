  `I am applying for the ${addressee.role} role at ${addressee.company}. Total Rewards, People Analytics, and People Operations is the function I have been running in pieces for 13+ years, and Headway is the first posting I have seen that pulls them into a single role reporting directly to the CPO. I am also a healthcare practitioner on paper only: my day-to-day at Wellstar Health System is Total Rewards analytics inside a large healthcare enterprise, which means I already speak fluently about benefits economics, utilization, and the measurement discipline behind a mission-driven employer.`,
  `Three pieces of evidence that map to this charter. First, Total Rewards analytics: I own the Wellstar dashboard suite (Compensation, Work-Life Services, Benefits, TOC navigation) in Tableau with data from BigQuery and SQL, built for decisions rather than reporting aesthetics. Second, People Analytics function-building: I would bring the same operating principle to Headway, which is that three KPIs leadership acts on beat thirty that look impressive. Third, executive and governance muscle: I led a $4.5M, 10-plus institution program at Harvard Medical School with audit-grade governance, which is the operating system a Head of TR needs for compensation committees, board reporting, and high-stakes cross-functional work.`,
  `I want to be direct about level. I am a program leader stepping into a Head of role. I would accept a downlevel to Senior Director or Director of Total Rewards Programs if that is the honest fit, provided the scope stays intact (TR plus People Analytics plus People Ops). Strategic initiatives like exploring a self-funded benefits transition are exactly the work I want to run, and I would come in with the discipline to do it thoughtfully.`,
  `On tooling I work across Tableau, Power BI, SQL, BigQuery, and PowerQuery with an AI-integrated workflow (Vertex AI, Gemini, OpenAI/Azure OpenAI, GCP, Cloud Run). That toolkit is increasingly the modern stack a Head of People Analytics is expected to operate in, and I already do. I would welcome a short conversation about the TR and People Analytics roadmap this year and where this seat fits. Thank you for the consideration.`,
