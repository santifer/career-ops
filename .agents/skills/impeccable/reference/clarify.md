> **Additional context needed**: audience technical level and users' mental state in context.

Find the unclear, confusing, or poorly written interface text and rewrite it. Vague copy creates support tickets and abandonment; specific copy gets users through the task.


---

## Assess Current Copy

Identify what makes the text unclear or ineffective:

1. **Find clarity problems**:
   - **Jargon**: Technical terms users won't understand
   - **Ambiguity**: Multiple interpretations possible
   - **Passive voice**: "Your file has been uploaded" vs "We uploaded your file"
   - **Length**: Too wordy or too terse
   - **Assumptions**: Assuming user knowledge they don't have
   - **Missing context**: Users don't know what to do or why
   - **Tone mismatch**: Too formal, too casual, or inappropriate for situation

2. **Understand the context**:
   - Who's the audience? (Technical? General? First-time users?)
   - What's the user's mental state? (Stressed during error? Confident during success?)
   - What's the action? (What do we want users to do?)
   - What's the constraint? (Character limits? Space limitations?)

**CRITICAL**: Clear copy helps users succeed. Unclear copy creates frustration, errors, and support tickets.

## Plan Copy Improvements

Create a strategy for clearer communication:

- **Primary message**: What's the ONE thing users need to know?
- **Action needed**: What should users do next (if anything)?
- **Tone**: How should this feel? (Helpful? Apologetic? Encouraging?)
- **Constraints**: Length limits, brand voice, localization considerations

**IMPORTANT**: Good UX writing is invisible. Users should understand immediately without noticing the words.

## Improve Copy Systematically

Refine text across these common areas:

### Error Messages
**Bad**: "Error 403: Forbidden"
**Good**: "You don't have permission to view this page. Contact your admin for access."

**Bad**: "Invalid input"
**Good**: "Email addresses need an @ symbol. Try: name@example.com"

**Principles**:
- Explain what went wrong in plain language
- Suggest how to fix it
- Don't blame the user
- Include examples when helpful
- Link to help/support if applicable

### Form Labels & Instructions
**Bad**: "DOB (MM/DD/YYYY)"
**Good**: "Date of birth" (with placeholder showing format)

**Bad**: "Enter value here"
**Good**: "Your email address" or "Company name"

**Principles**:
- Use clear, specific labels (not generic placeholders)
- Show format expectations with examples
- Explain why you're asking (when not obvious)
- Put instructions before the field, not after
- Keep required field indicators clear

### Button & CTA Text
**Bad**: "Click here" | "Submit" | "OK"
**Good**: "Create account" | "Save changes" | "Got it, thanks"

**Principles**:
- Describe the action specifically
- Use active voice (verb + noun)
- Match user's mental model
- Be specific ("Save" is better than "OK")

### Help Text & Tooltips
**Bad**: "This is the username field"
**Good**: "Choose a username. You can change this later in Settings."

**Principles**:
- Add value (don't just repeat the label)
- Answer the implicit question ("What is this?" or "Why do you need this?")
- Keep it brief but complete
- Link to detailed docs if needed

### Empty States
**Bad**: "No items"
**Good**: "No projects yet. Create your first project to get started."

**Principles**:
- Explain why it's empty (if not obvious)
- Show next action clearly
- Make it welcoming, not dead-end

### Success Messages
**Bad**: "Success"
**Good**: "Settings saved! Your changes will take effect immediately."

**Principles**:
- Confirm what happened
- Explain what happens next (if relevant)
- Be brief but complete
- Match the user's emotional moment (celebrate big wins)

### Loading States
**Bad**: "Loading..." (for 30+ seconds)
**Good**: "Analyzing your data... this usually takes 30-60 seconds"

**Principles**:
- Set expectations (how long?)
- Explain what's happening (when it's not obvious)
- Show progress when possible
- Offer escape hatch if appropriate ("Cancel")

### Confirmation Dialogs
**Bad**: "Are you sure?"
**Good**: "Delete 'Project Alpha'? This can't be undone."

**Principles**:
- State the specific action
- Explain consequences (especially for destructive actions)
- Use clear button labels ("Delete project" not "Yes")
- Don't overuse confirmations (only for risky actions)

### Navigation & Wayfinding
**Bad**: Generic labels like "Items" | "Things" | "Stuff"
**Good**: Specific labels like "Your projects" | "Team members" | "Settings"

**Principles**:
- Be specific and descriptive
- Use language users understand (not internal jargon)
- Make hierarchy clear
- Consider information scent (breadcrumbs, current location)

## Apply Clarity Principles

Every piece of copy should follow these rules:

1. **Be specific**: "Enter email" not "Enter value"
2. **Be concise**: Cut unnecessary words (but don't sacrifice clarity)
3. **Be active**: "Save changes" not "Changes will be saved"
4. **Be human**: "Oops, something went wrong" not "System error encountered"
5. **Tell users what to do**, not just what happened
6. **Be consistent**: Use same terms throughout (don't vary for variety)

**NEVER**:
- Use jargon without explanation
- Blame users ("You made an error" → "This field is required")
- Be vague ("Something went wrong" without explanation)
- Use passive voice unnecessarily
- Write overly long explanations (be concise)
- Use humor for errors (be empathetic instead)
- Assume technical knowledge
- Vary terminology (pick one term and stick with it)
- Repeat information (headers restating intros, redundant explanations)
- Use placeholders as the only labels (they disappear when users type)

## Verify Improvements

Test that copy improvements work:

- **Comprehension**: Can users understand without context?
- **Actionability**: Do users know what to do next?
- **Brevity**: Is it as short as possible while remaining clear?
- **Consistency**: Does it match terminology elsewhere?
- **Tone**: Is it appropriate for the situation?

When the copy reads cleanly, hand off to `$impeccable polish` for the final pass.

## Reference Material

The sections below were previously `ux-writing.md` and live inline now so the clarify flow has its deep UX-writing reference in one place.

### UX Writing

#### The Button Label Problem

**Never use "OK", "Submit", or "Yes/No".** These are lazy and ambiguous. Use specific verb + object patterns:

| Bad | Good | Why |
|-----|------|-----|
| OK | Save changes | Says what will happen |
| Submit | Create account | Outcome-focused |
| Yes | Delete message | Confirms the action |
| Cancel | Keep editing | Clarifies what "cancel" means |
| Click here | Download PDF | Describes the destination |

**For destructive actions**, name the destruction:
- "Delete" not "Remove" (delete is permanent, remove implies recoverable)
- "Delete 5 items" not "Delete selected" (show the count)

#### Error Messages: The Formula

Every error message should answer: (1) What happened? (2) Why? (3) How to fix it? Example: "Email address isn't valid. Please include an @ symbol." not "Invalid input".

##### Error Message Templates

| Situation | Template |
|-----------|----------|
| **Format error** | "[Field] needs to be [format]. Example: [example]" |
| **Missing required** | "Please enter [what's missing]" |
| **Permission denied** | "You don't have access to [thing]. [What to do instead]" |
| **Network error** | "We couldn't reach [thing]. Check your connection and [action]." |
| **Server error** | "Something went wrong on our end. We're looking into it. [Alternative action]" |

##### Don't Blame the User

Reframe errors: "Please enter a date in MM/DD/YYYY format" not "You entered an invalid date".

#### Empty States Are Opportunities

Empty states are onboarding moments: (1) Acknowledge briefly, (2) Explain the value of filling it, (3) Provide a clear action. "No projects yet. Create your first one to get started." not just "No items".

#### Voice vs Tone

**Voice** is your brand's personality, consistent everywhere.
**Tone** adapts to the moment.

| Moment | Tone Shift |
|--------|------------|
| Success | Celebratory, brief: "Done! Your changes are live." |
| Error | Empathetic, helpful: "That didn't work. Here's what to try..." |
| Loading | Reassuring: "Saving your work..." |
| Destructive confirm | Serious, clear: "Delete this project? This can't be undone." |

**Never use humor for errors.** Users are already frustrated. Be helpful, not cute.

#### Writing for Accessibility

**Link text** must have standalone meaning: "View pricing plans" not "Click here". **Alt text** describes information, not the image: "Revenue increased 40% in Q4" not "Chart". Use `alt=""` for decorative images. **Icon buttons** need `aria-label` for screen reader context.

#### Writing for Translation

##### Plan for Expansion

German text is ~30% longer than English. Allocate space:

| Language | Expansion |
|----------|-----------|
| German | +30% |
| French | +20% |
| Finnish | +30-40% |
| Chinese | -30% (fewer chars, but same width) |

##### Translation-Friendly Patterns

Keep numbers separate ("New messages: 3" not "You have 3 new messages"). Use full sentences as single strings (word order varies by language). Avoid abbreviations ("5 minutes ago" not "5 mins ago"). Give translators context about where strings appear.

#### Consistency: The Terminology Problem

Pick one term and stick with it:

| Inconsistent | Consistent |
|--------------|------------|
| Delete / Remove / Trash | Delete |
| Settings / Preferences / Options | Settings |
| Sign in / Log in / Enter | Sign in |
| Create / Add / New | Create |

Build a terminology glossary and enforce it. Variety creates confusion.

#### Avoid Redundant Copy

If the heading explains it, the intro is redundant. If the button is clear, don't explain it again. Say it once, say it well.

#### Loading States

Be specific: "Saving your draft..." not "Loading...". For long waits, set expectations ("This usually takes 30 seconds") or show progress.

#### Confirmation Dialogs: Use Sparingly

Most confirmation dialogs are design failures; consider undo instead. When you must confirm: name the action, explain consequences, use specific button labels ("Delete project" / "Keep project", not "Yes" / "No").

#### Form Instructions

Show format with placeholders, not instructions. For non-obvious fields, explain why you're asking.

---

**Avoid**: Jargon without explanation. Blaming users ("You made an error" → "This field is required"). Vague errors ("Something went wrong"). Varying terminology for variety. Humor for errors.
