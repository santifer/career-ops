# Mode: scan — Portal Scanner (Job Discovery)

Scan configured job portals, filter by title relevance, and add new postings to the pipeline for later evaluation.

## Recommended Execution

Run as a subagent to avoid consuming main context:

```
sessions_spawn({
  label: "🔍 Portal Scanner",
  task: "[content of this file + specific data]",
  mode: "run",
  runTimeoutSeconds: 600
})
```

## Configuration

Read `portals.yml` which contains:
- `search_queries`: List of `web_search` queries with `site:` filters per portal (broad discovery)
- `tracked_companies`: Specific companies with `careers_url` for direct navigation
- `title_filter`: positive/negative/seniority_boost keywords for title filtering

## Discovery Strategy (3 levels)

### Level 1 — Browser direct (PRIMARY)

**For each company in `tracked_companies`:** Navigate to their `careers_url` with the `browser` tool (`navigate` + `snapshot`), read ALL visible job listings, and extract title + URL for each. This is the most reliable method because:
- Sees the page in real time (not cached Google results)
- Works with SPAs (Ashby, Lever, Workday)
- Detects new postings instantly
- Doesn't depend on Google indexing

**Each company MUST have `careers_url` in portals.yml.** If not, search for it once, save it, and use in future scans.

### Level 2 — ATS APIs / Feeds (COMPLEMENTARY)

For companies with public API or structured feed, use the JSON/XML response as a quick complement to Level 1. Faster than browser and reduces visual scraping errors.

**Current support (variables in `{}`):**
- **Greenhouse**: `https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{company}/jobs`
- **Ashby**: `https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/api/non-user-graphql?op=ApiJobBoardWithTeams`
- **BambooHR**: list `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/list`; detail `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail`
- **Lever**: `https://api.lever.co/v0/postings/{company}?mode=json`
- **Teamtailor**: `https://{company}.teamtailor.com/jobs.rss`
- **Workday**: `https://{company}.{shard}.myworkdayjobs.com/wday/cxs/{company}/{site}/jobs`

**Parsing convention by provider:**
- `greenhouse`: `jobs[]` → `title`, `absolute_url`
- `ashby`: GraphQL `ApiJobBoardWithTeams` with `organizationHostedJobsPageName={company}` → `jobBoard.jobPostings[]` (`title`, `id`; build public URL if not in payload)
- `bamboohr`: list `result[]` → `jobOpeningName`, `id`; build detail URL `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail`; for full JD, GET the detail and use `result.jobOpening` (`jobOpeningName`, `description`, `datePosted`, `minimumExperience`, `compensation`, `jobOpeningShareUrl`)
- `lever`: root array `[]` → `text`, `hostedUrl` (fallback: `applyUrl`)
- `teamtailor`: RSS items → `title`, `link`
- `workday`: `jobPostings[]`/`jobPostings` (varies by tenant) → `title`, `externalPath` or URL built from host

### Level 3 — web_search queries (BROAD DISCOVERY)

The `search_queries` with `site:` filters cover portals cross-sectionally (all Ashby, all Greenhouse, etc.). Useful for discovering NEW companies not yet in `tracked_companies`, but results may be outdated.

**Execution priority:**
1. Level 1: Browser → all `tracked_companies` with `careers_url`
2. Level 2: API → all `tracked_companies` with `api:`
3. Level 3: web_search → all `search_queries` with `enabled: true`

Levels are additive — all execute, results merge and deduplicate.

## Workflow

1. **Read configuration**: `portals.yml`
2. **Read history**: `data/scan-history.tsv` → already-seen URLs
3. **Read dedup sources**: `data/applications.md` + `data/pipeline.md`

4. **Level 1 — Browser scan** (parallel in batches of 3-5):
   For each company in `tracked_companies` with `enabled: true` and `careers_url` defined:
   a. `browser` action `navigate` to the `careers_url`
   b. `browser` action `snapshot` to read all job listings
   c. If the page has filters/departments, navigate relevant sections
   d. For each job listing extract: `{title, url, company}`
   e. If the page paginates results, navigate additional pages
   f. Accumulate in candidate list
   g. If `careers_url` fails (404, redirect), try `scan_query` as fallback and note for URL update

5. **Level 2 — ATS APIs / feeds** (parallel):
   For each company in `tracked_companies` with `api:` defined and `enabled: true`:
   a. `web_fetch` the API/feed URL
   b. If `api_provider` is defined, use its parser; if not, infer by domain (`boards-api.greenhouse.io`, `jobs.ashbyhq.com`, `api.lever.co`, `*.bamboohr.com`, `*.teamtailor.com`, `*.myworkdayjobs.com`)
   c. For **Ashby**, send POST with:
      - `operationName: ApiJobBoardWithTeams`
      - `variables.organizationHostedJobsPageName: {company}`
      - GraphQL query of `jobBoardWithTeams` + `jobPostings { id title locationName employmentType compensationTierSummary }`
   d. For **BambooHR**, the list only brings basic metadata. For each relevant item, read `id`, GET `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail`, and extract the full JD from `result.jobOpening`. Use `jobOpeningShareUrl` as public URL if available; otherwise use the detail URL.
   e. For **Workday**, send POST JSON with at least `{"appliedFacets":{},"limit":20,"offset":0,"searchText":""}` and paginate by `offset` until results exhausted
   f. For each job extract and normalize: `{title, url, company}`
   g. Accumulate in candidate list (dedup with Level 1)

6. **Level 3 — web_search queries** (parallel if possible):
   For each query in `search_queries` with `enabled: true`:
   a. Execute `web_search` with the defined `query`
   b. From each result extract: `{title, url, company}`
      - **title**: from the result title (before " @ " or " | ")
      - **url**: result URL
      - **company**: after " @ " in title, or extract from domain/path
   c. Accumulate in candidate list (dedup with Level 1+2)

6. **Filter by title** using `title_filter` from `portals.yml`:
   - At least 1 keyword from `positive` must appear in title (case-insensitive)
   - 0 keywords from `negative` must appear
   - `seniority_boost` keywords give priority but are not mandatory

7. **Deduplicate** against 3 sources:
   - `scan-history.tsv` → exact URL already seen
   - `applications.md` → company + normalized role already evaluated
   - `pipeline.md` → exact URL already in pending or processed

7.5. **Verify liveness of web_search results (Level 3)** — BEFORE adding to pipeline:

   web_search results can be outdated (Google caches results for weeks or months). To avoid evaluating expired postings, verify with the browser tool each new URL from Level 3. Levels 1 and 2 are inherently real-time and do not require this verification.

   For each new URL from Level 3 (sequential — NEVER browser in parallel):
   a. `browser` action `navigate` to the URL
   b. `browser` action `snapshot` to read content
   c. Classify:
      - **Active**: job title visible + role description + visible Apply/Submit control within main content. Don't count generic header/navbar/footer text.
      - **Expired** (any of these signals):
        - Final URL contains `?error=true` (Greenhouse redirects here when posting is closed)
        - Page contains: "job no longer available" / "no longer open" / "position has been filled" / "this job has expired" / "page not found"
        - Only navbar and footer visible, no JD content (content < ~300 chars)
   d. If expired: record in `scan-history.tsv` with status `skipped_expired` and discard
   e. If active: continue to step 8

   **Do not interrupt the entire scan if one URL fails.** If `navigate` gives an error (timeout, 403, etc.), mark as `skipped_expired` and continue with the next.

8. **For each new verified posting that passes filters**:
   a. Add to `pipeline.md` "Pendientes" section: `- [ ] {url} | {company} | {title}`
   b. Record in `scan-history.tsv`: `{url}\t{date}\t{query_name}\t{title}\t{company}\tadded`

9. **Postings filtered by title**: record in `scan-history.tsv` with status `skipped_title`
10. **Duplicate postings**: record with status `skipped_dup`
11. **Expired postings (Level 3)**: record with status `skipped_expired`

## Extracting title and company from web_search results

web_search results come in format: `"Job Title @ Company"` or `"Job Title | Company"` or `"Job Title — Company"`.

Extraction patterns by portal:
- **Ashby**: `"Senior AI PM (Remote) @ EverAI"` → title: `Senior AI PM`, company: `EverAI`
- **Greenhouse**: `"AI Engineer at Anthropic"` → title: `AI Engineer`, company: `Anthropic`
- **Lever**: `"Product Manager - AI @ Temporal"` → title: `Product Manager - AI`, company: `Temporal`

Generic regex: `(.+?)(?:\s*[@|—–-]\s*|\s+at\s+)(.+?)$`

## Private URLs

If a URL is not publicly accessible:
1. Save the JD in `jds/{company}-{role-slug}.md`
2. Add to pipeline.md as: `- [ ] local:jds/{company}-{role-slug}.md | {company} | {title}`

## Scan History

`data/scan-history.tsv` tracks ALL seen URLs:

```
url	first_seen	portal	title	company	status
https://...	2026-02-10	Ashby — AI PM	PM AI	Acme	added
https://...	2026-02-10	Greenhouse — SA	Junior Dev	BigCo	skipped_title
https://...	2026-02-10	Ashby — AI PM	SA AI	OldCo	skipped_dup
https://...	2026-02-10	WebSearch — AI PM	PM AI	ClosedCo	skipped_expired
```

## Output Summary

```
Portal Scan — {YYYY-MM-DD}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Queries executed: N
Postings found: N total
Filtered by title: N relevant
Duplicates: N (already evaluated or in pipeline)
Expired discarded: N (dead links, Level 3)

## careers_url Management

Each company in `tracked_companies` must have `careers_url` — the direct URL to their job page. This avoids searching every time.

**Known patterns by platform:**
- **Ashby:** `https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/{slug}`
- **Greenhouse:** `https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/{slug}` or `https://job-boards.eu.greenhouse.io/{slug}`
- **Lever:** `https://jobs.lever.co/{slug}`
- **BambooHR:** list `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/list`; detail `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail`
- **Teamtailor:** `https://{company}.teamtailor.com/jobs`
- **Workday:** `https://{company}.{shard}.myworkdayjobs.com/{site}`
- **Custom:** The company's own URL (e.g. `https://openai.com/careers`)

**API/feed patterns by platform:**
- **Ashby API:** `https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/api/non-user-graphql?op=ApiJobBoardWithTeams`
- **BambooHR API:** list `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/list`; detail `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail` (`result.jobOpening`)
- **Lever API:** `https://api.lever.co/v0/postings/{company}?mode=json`
- **Teamtailor RSS:** `https://{company}.teamtailor.com/jobs.rss`
- **Workday API:** `https://{company}.{shard}.myworkdayjobs.com/wday/cxs/{company}/{site}/jobs`

**If `careers_url` doesn't exist** for a company:
1. Try the pattern for its known platform
2. If that fails, do a quick `web_search`: `"{company}" careers jobs`
3. Navigate with browser to confirm it works
4. **Save the found URL in portals.yml** for future scans

**If `careers_url` returns 404 or redirect:**
1. Note in the output summary
2. Try scan_query as fallback
3. Flag for manual update

## portals.yml Maintenance

- **ALWAYS save `careers_url`** when adding a new company
- Add new queries as portals or interesting roles are discovered
- Disable queries with `enabled: false` if they generate too much noise
- Adjust filtering keywords as target roles evolve
- Add companies to `tracked_companies` when worth tracking closely
- Verify `careers_url` periodically — companies change ATS platforms
