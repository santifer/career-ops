/**
 * check-liveness.mjs — Playwright job link liveness checker
 *
 * Tests whether job posting URLs are still active or have expired.
 * Uses the same detection logic as scan.md step 7.5.
 * Zero Claude API tokens. Two rungs: a free public-API check first
 * (liveness-api.mjs, no browser), then Playwright for everything else.
 *
 * An `expired` verdict is recorded back into data/scan-history.tsv as a
 * `skipped_expired` row, so a posting confirmed dead once stops resurfacing
 * (#3891). See recordExpiredVerdicts below for why that is default-on.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node check-liveness.mjs <url1> [url2] ...
 *   node check-liveness.mjs --file urls.txt
 *
 * Exit code: 0 if all active, 1 if any expired or uncertain

 *
 * The row is stamped with localToday(), like every other scan-history writer:
 * a UTC day is the wrong day for most of the world for part of every day.
 *
 * The read and the append share ONE critical section. What to append is decided
 * by what the file already says, so reading outside the lock is a check-then-act:
 * a scanner appending the same `skipped_expired` row in between would leave two
 * death certificates for one posting. The lock is not reentrant, hence
 * `alreadyLocked` on the append rather than a second acquisition.
